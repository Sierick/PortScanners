Thanks for taking the time to read this readme!

The PortScannerWhileLoop.py is a brute force port scanner.
It scans every tcp port on a given ipv4 and then prints the open ports
I haven't tested it on a ipv6 so I don't know if it works with ipv6
You can change the timeout speed to be faster but this can cause false negitives
If you are running this from the linux command terminal type the command python3 PortScannerWhileLoop.py

PLEASE BE AWARE:
THIS ISN"T A STEALTH PORT SCANNER so please only use it against targets you have permission to scan becuase it is a very loud port scanner.

By downloading my code you agree that I cannot be held responible for your actions with it.

Enjoy!
